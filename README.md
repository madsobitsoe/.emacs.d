My emacs.d
====

Based on magnars/emacsRocks!  config.
Most of the snippets are stolen from his or various other configs around the net.

**usage**

I wouldn't recommend using the entire thing. Instead, grab the pieces you find useful.

Structure
====

package is setup with auto-install function in setup-package.el. It will install all packages into .emacs.d/site-lisp instead of .emacs.d/elpa, so make sure to create that directory.

All my "load files" are in the folder my-setup.
